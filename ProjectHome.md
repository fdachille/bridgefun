### The Goal ###
Your goal is to build a structurally sound bridge across the topmost horizontal span, within a given budget.

### How to Build ###
You build by left clicking on any existing anchor point or pin joint, dragging a short distance (about 4 units) and clicking again to place the member. You can stop building or delete any member or joint by right clicking on it. You can change the material type to by using the buttons on the top. Continue until you run out of money. Note that the topmost span must be built of steel not cable.

### How to Test ###
After construction is complete, you can test the structure by clicking the test button.
